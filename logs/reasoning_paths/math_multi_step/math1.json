      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the distance traveled during the first part of the journey:**\n   * Distance = Speed x Time\n   * Distance (first part) = 60 km/h * 2 hours = 120 km\n\n2. **Calculate the distance traveled during the second part of the journey:**\n   * Distance = Speed x Time\n   * Distance (second part) = 80 km/h * 3 hours = 240 km\n\n3. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**\n   * Total distance = Distance (first part) + Distance (second part)\n   * Total distance = 120 km + 240 km = 360 km\n\nAnswer: 360 km",
