      "Let's represent the number as 'x'.\nThe problem states: \"5 times a number minus 7 equals 18\". We can translate this into an algebraic equation:\n5x - 7 = 18\n\nNow, we need to solve for x.\n1. Add 7 to both sides of the equation:\n   5x - 7 + 7 = 18 + 7\n   5x = 25\n\n2. Divide both sides by 5:\n   5x / 5 = 25 / 5\n   x = 5\n\nAnswer: 5",

      "Let's represent the number as 'x'.  We can translate the word problem into an algebraic equation:\n\n1.  \"5 times a number\" can be written as 5x.\n2.  \"minus 7\" means we subtract 7.\n3.  The whole expression \"5 times a number minus 7\" is equal to 18. So, we have the equation 5x - 7 = 18.\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n1.
